# Obstacle Avoidance Robot
## Overview
* This project simulates an obstacle avoidance robot using Python.
* The robot is equipped with an ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles and navigate its environment.
* The simulation uses `pygame` for graphical representation and `numpy` for mathematical calculations.
  
## Features
* **Obstacle Detection:** The robot uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles within a certain range.
* **Obstacle Avoidance:** The robot adjusts its movement based on the detected obstacles to avoid collisions
* **Simulation Graphics:** Visual representation of the robot, its environment, and sensor data using pygame.

## Files
* `Robot.py`: Contains the main logic for the robot's movement, obstacle avoidance, and kinematics.
* `main.py`: The entry point of the simulation, which initializes the graphics, robot, and sensor, and runs the simulation loop.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/obstacle-avoidance-robot.git
   cd obstacle-avoidance-robot
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```pip install pygame numpy```

## Usage
1. Place your images (`DDR.png` and `ObstacleMap.png`) in the same directory as `main.py`.
2. Run the simulation:
   ```python main.py```
   The simulation window will open, displaying the robot and its environment. The robot will attempt to avoid obstacles as it moves.

## Code Overview
### `Robot.py`
* `Robot class`: Manages the robot's position, speed, heading, and obstacle avoidance logic.
* `Graphics class`: Handles the rendering of the robot and sensor data.
* `Ultrasonic class`: Simulates the ultrasonic sensor's detection of obstacles.

### `main.py`
* Initializes the graphics, robot, and ultrasonic sensor.
* Runs the simulation loop, updating the robot's position and rendering the environment and sensor data.
